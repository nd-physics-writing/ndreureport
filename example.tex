\section{Introduction}

\lipsum[3]

Here is an example of how you reference papers. The BibTeX citations go in your .bib file. This is some information \cite{sample}.

\subsection{Subsection}

\lipsum[4]

Let's show an example of how you add in math. You can add it inline like this: $a = b + c$, or you can add it outside of the text.

\begin{equation}
    a = b + c
    \label{eq:a}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Subsection}

\lipsum[3]

Now we'll do inline references to figures/tables/equations that you have in your paper. If you look at Figure \ref{fig:test} you'll see a sample figure. This has nothing to do with Equation \ref{eq:a}.

\section{Background}

\lipsum[5]

Here's a sample table:

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{c|l|r}
        Col 1 & Col 2 & Col 3 \\ \hline
        A & a & 1.0 \\ 
        B & b & 2.0 \\  
        C & c & 3.0    
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

\section{Methods}

\lipsum[2]

\section{Results}

\lipsum[6]

Here is a sample figure:

\begin{figure}[ht!]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=0.9\textwidth]{fig_2.eps}
    \caption{Figure caption goes here}
    \label{fig:test}
\end{figure}

The ht! options tell \LaTeX where to put the figure (here (h), top (t), and override what it thinks is best(!)).
